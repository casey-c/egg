## About
EGG is a program that allows users to manipulate existential graphs, a diagrammatic method of visualizing logical arguments in a concise, 2-dimensional format. [Existential graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph) were developed by American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in the late 19th century as an alternative to the text-dense methodology of classical logics. Although existential graphs provide a radical approach to studying logical arguments, the difficulties involved with traditional paper/pencil techniques have largely hindered adoption. EGG seeks to enlist the computer to create an environment suitable for the creation, manipulation, and analysis of existential graphs, complete with detailed step-by-step tracking and pictoral visualization.

## Release
EGG is currently under the initial stages of development and will not have a working release for some time.
