## About
EGG is a program that allows users to manipulate existential graphs, a diagrammatic method of visualizing logical arguments in a concise, 2-dimensional format. [Existential graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_graph) were developed by American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce in the late 19th century as an alternative to the text-dense methodology of classical logics. Although existential graphs provide a radical approach to studying logical arguments, the difficulties involved with traditional paper/pencil techniques have largely hindered adoption. EGG seeks to enlist the computer to create an environment suitable for the creation, manipulation, and analysis of existential graphs, complete with detailed step-by-step history and visualization.

## Involvement
We are currently looking for more contributors who can use c++ or Qt to develop the front-end as well as the back-end of the project.
Feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/casey-c/egg/issues) or create a pull request. Contact one of us for more information!

## Release
EGG is currently under the initial stages of development and will not have a working release for some time.
